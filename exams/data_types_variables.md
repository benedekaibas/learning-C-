# C++ Variables and Data Types Exam

## Multiple Choice Questions

1. **Which of the following is the correct way to declare an integer variable in C++?**  
   A) `int integer_value = 4;`  
   B) `integer int_value = 4;`  
   C) `integer_value int = 4;`  
   D) `int_value integer = 4;`

   Answer A is the correct answer since in c++ you have to declare the type of the variable before
   its name. In this case, it is an integer value since 4 is an integer. Integers` size is either 2 or 4 bytes.

2. **What is the correct data type for a variable that stores a single character?**  
   A) `char`  
   B) `string`  
   C) `bool`  
   D) `int`

   A is the correct answer since char is used for storing single character and its size is 1 byte.

3. **Which of the following is a valid boolean value in C++?**  
   A) `yes`  
   B) `no`  
   C) `true`  
   D) `1`

   Answer C is the correct. Boolean value has a size of 1 byte and its value is either true or false.
